Application Overview
OCR File Verificator & Deleter is a desktop application designed for efficient document management. It automates the process of verifying and deleting scanned image files in a designated folder. By using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), the application identifies documents that contain specific keywords, such as ID numbers or names. This tool is optimized for high-speed batch processing and helps streamline your document workflow by automatically removing files that have been correctly identified.


How to Use
1. Enter Keywords: In the keyword box, enter identifiers such as ID numbers or names you want to search for. Enter one set of keywords per line. The application will delete a file only if all keywords on a single line are found within the document's text.

2. Start Processing: Click the "start processing" button to begin the OCR and file deletion process. A progress bar will show the current status. When the process is complete or canceled, a dialog box will appear to notify you.

3. Cancel: To stop the process at any time, click the "CANCEL" button.

4. Open Folder: Click the "open folder" button to quickly open the currently selected folder in Windows Explorer.

5. Review Results: After the process is complete, the files that were not processed will remain in the folder. A log file named ImageProcessLog.txt will also be generated, detailing which files were processed, their duration, and the final result ("Deleted," "Kept," or "ERROR").


How to Configure
The application's settings and options can be adjusted in two ways: through the user interface and by editing the configuration file.


1. User Interface Settings
These settings are saved automatically when the application closes and will be applied the next time you open the app.

- Folder Path: The application remembers the last folder you selected. You only need to change this if you are processing files from a different location.
- Language Selection: Use the language drop-down menu to change the application's display language.
- Debug Mode: Check the "debug" box to enable debug mode. When this mode is active, the application will save intermediate images and OCR text files to a debug subfolder within the processed directory. This is useful for troubleshooting OCR issues and for fine-tuning the ocr_params.ini file.
- About: Click the "about" button to display information about the application, including its version number, copyright, and developer details.


2. Configuration File (ocr_params.ini)
For advanced OCR and system-level settings, edit the ocr_params.ini file located in the application's startup directory.

[OCR] Section
- Languages: Specifies the OCR language. Example: eng+jpn for both English and Japanese, eng for English, jpn for Japanese.
- UserDefinedDpi: Sets the DPI for OCR processing. Recommended value: 300.
- PageSegMode: Determines how Tesseract segments the page. You can set it to Auto for automatic mode or SingleBlock for specific layouts.

[System] Section
- MaxDegreeOfParallelism: Controls the number of threads for OCR processing. Recommended value: 4 to 8.
- OpenMpThreads: Specifies the number of OpenMP threads for Tesseract. It's recommended to use the same value as MaxDegreeOfParallelism.
- SkewSkipThresholdDeg: The minimum angle of skew to apply deskewing. Recommended value: 0.2.
- MadThresholdDeg: The threshold for Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) to switch to projection profile for deskewing. Recommended value: 0.8.
